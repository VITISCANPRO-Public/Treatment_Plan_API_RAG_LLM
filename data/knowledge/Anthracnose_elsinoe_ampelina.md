# 1. Description and Symptoms

Anthracnose is a cryptogamic disease primarily affecting young leaves, shoots and berries.
It typically appears early in the season following rainy episodes.

**On leaves:**
- small circular dark brown to black spots
- greyish centers with dark borders ("bird's eye" appearance)
- perforations of the blade when necrotic tissue falls away

**On shoots:**
- elongated dark brown to black streaks
- cracks and depressions on young tissues

**On bunches:**
- necrotic spots on young berries
- risk of cracking and secondary infections

Without intervention, anthracnose can cause significant deformations and permanently weaken vegetation.

# 2. Risk Situations

- Rainy spring → rapid contamination
- Vigorous plants with sensitive young tissues
- Susceptible varieties (some hybrids, muscats…)
- Late cultural operations (wounds favoring contamination)
- Poor canopy ventilation
- Plot history of the disease

---

# 3. Field Diagnosis

To confirm anthracnose, observe:

1. **Circular black lesions with pale center**, often perforated
2. **Early symptoms**, from the first unfolded leaves
3. **Elongated lesions** on canes → distinctive criterion
4. Distinguish from:
   - **Black rot**: brown spots with black pycnidia
   - **Nutrient deficiencies**: no marked necrotic border
   - **Climate burns**: less regular shapes

Anthracnose is generally heterogeneous across the plot at the start.

# 4. Potential Impact on Yield

- Partial defoliation under heavy attack
- Stunted growth and weakening of young canes
- Berry loss at young berry stage
- Increased risk of secondary diseases on weakened tissues
- Significant yield reduction in wet years

The damage is greater the earlier the infection occurs.

---

# 5. Treatment Strategies — Conventional

General principles:
- preventive protection from bud break during rainy weather
- **early treatments** are critical (young stages = highly sensitive)
- rotate active ingredients according to regulations
- avoid any plant wounds before rainy periods

Common interventions:
- contact products to protect young tissues
- reinforce after heavy rain or rapid growth

These strategies must be integrated into the overall vineyard protection program.

# 6. Treatment Strategies — Organic Farming

In organic farming, control relies on:

- **copper** (strict annual quantity rules)
- **biocontrol products** for prevention
- vigor reduction: limit very tender shoots
- improved canopy ventilation (controlled leaf removal)
- removal of heavily affected canes

Efficacy depends strongly on application regularity in humid conditions.

# 7. Adjustments by Severity

**Case 1 — A few leaves affected**
→ increased monitoring + preventive protection.

**Case 2 — Symptoms on young canes**
→ rapid intervention + protection before forecast rain.

**Case 3 — Damage on young berries**
→ reinforced treatment and reduction of inoculum sources.

# 8. Preventive Measures

- prune cleanly and remove affected wood
- avoid wounds before humid periods
- reduce excessive vigor
- improve row ventilation
- manage irrigation and water stress
- monitor weather forecasts to anticipate contamination

---

# 9. Safety and Precautions

- respect mixing rules and buffer zones (ZNT)
- young tissues are highly sensitive — handle with care
- avoid treatments during rain or just before heavy rainfall
- wear PPE and calibrate sprayer precisely
- comply with local regulations on authorized products

These recommendations must be adapted to the variety, local climate and regulatory constraints.
