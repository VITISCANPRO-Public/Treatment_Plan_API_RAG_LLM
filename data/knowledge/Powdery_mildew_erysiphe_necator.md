# 1. Description and Symptoms

Powdery mildew is one of the most feared diseases in viticulture.
Its development can cause significant losses in both yield and quality.

**On leaves:**
- whitish powdery patches ("white dust")
- irregular felty areas
- curled, deformed leaves
- yellowing or necrosis in advanced cases

**On shoots:**
- whitish areas
- ashy appearance
- persistent black streaks late in the season (old lesions)

**On bunches and berries:**
- whitening of the cuticle
- stunted berry growth
- **cracking** under pressure → entry point for botrytis
- hard berries, altered taste (musty, bitter)

Without intervention, severe secondary contamination can destroy the harvest.

---

# 2. Risk Situations

- Mild spring (16–20°C) → frequent primary infection
- Alternating night humidity and daytime heat
- Dense, poorly ventilated canopy
- Susceptible varieties: Chardonnay, Syrah, Carignan, Gamay
- History of powdery mildew in the plot
- Failure to follow preventive treatment schedule
- Poor soils → insufficient vigor → less foliage renewal

---

# 3. Field Diagnosis

To confirm powdery mildew:

1. Look for **white felty growth** easily removed by rubbing with a finger.
2. Observe the **upper side** of leaves, usually the most affected.
3. Examine bunches: whitening, hardening, split berries.
4. Scratch gently with a fingernail → white powder detaches.
5. Distinguish from other diseases:
   - **Downy mildew**: oily spot + white downy growth *underneath*
   - **Botrytis**: grey mold, not powdery
   - **Late powdery mildew**: persistent black lesions on canes

A ×10 magnifying glass allows observation of fruiting bodies.

# 4. Potential Impact on Yield

- Yield losses potentially exceeding **50%**
- Major alteration of aromatic quality
- Split then rotting berries → direct losses
- Increased risk of botrytis
- Oenological defects: volatile acidity, favoring of brettanomyces

This is a **very high priority** disease.

# 5. Treatment Strategies — Conventional

Control based on 3 pillars:

**5.1 Prevention (essential)**
- regular treatments **before** symptom appearance
- rotate active ingredients to prevent resistance
- continuous protection from **3–4 leaves stage → bunch closure**

**5.2 Commonly used products (subject to regulations)**
- penetrating or systemic fungicides
- anti-sporulation and anti-germination actions
- mandatory alternation of modes of action

**5.3 Tactical interventions**
- reinforce during hot dry periods
- add wetting agents depending on product
- prioritize bunch protection

Powdery mildew cannot be reversed: **what is lost is lost**.

# 6. Treatment Strategies — Organic Farming

Control primarily based on:

**6.1 Sulfur (cornerstone)**
- excellent efficacy when applied **regularly**
- interval: 7–12 days depending on weather
- risk of phytotoxicity above 30°C

**6.2 Biocontrol agents**
- bicarbonates
- plant extracts
- natural defense stimulators

**6.3 Cultural practices**
- controlled early leaf removal
- vigor adjustment
- trellis management to improve ventilation

In organic farming, **regularity** takes priority over product strength.

---

# 7. Adjustments by Severity

**Case 1 — Mild symptoms on leaves**
→ increase treatment frequency + systematically protect bunches.

**Case 2 — Visible symptoms on multiple shoots**
→ immediate intervention + rotate active ingredient.

**Case 3 — Symptoms on bunches (white powder)**
→ absolute emergency, double targeted protection:
- immediate anti-powdery mildew treatment
- early botrytis protection

---

# 8. Preventive Measures

- controlled leaf removal
- avoid excess vigor (nitrogen management)
- trellis management to improve ventilation
- regular microclimate monitoring
- limit water stress
- vineyard hygiene (eliminate persistent disease foci)

---

# 9. Safety and Precautions

- respect buffer zones (ZNT), PPE and regulatory doses
- caution with sulfur effects during very hot weather
- avoid incompatible mixtures (sulfur + oils for example)
- caution on varieties sensitive to phytotoxicity
- thorough equipment cleaning after each application

These recommendations must be adjusted according to local conditions, variety and season.
