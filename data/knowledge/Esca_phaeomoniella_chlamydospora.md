# 1. Description and Symptoms

Esca is a complex wood disease caused by a consortium of fungi.
It is one of the most serious threats to mature vineyards worldwide.
Two forms of expression exist: a **chronic form** and an **acute form (apoplexy)**.

**Chronic form — On leaves:**
- interveinal yellowing (white varieties) or reddening (red varieties)
- characteristic **tiger stripe pattern** on the blade
- leaf margins dry out progressively
- symptoms appear mid-summer, often on isolated vines

**Chronic form — On berries:**
- purple spots on the skin
- internal flesh browning
- reduced quality and premature drying

**Acute form — Apoplexy:**
- sudden wilting of the entire vine within a few days
- all leaves dry out simultaneously, remaining attached
- can kill the vine in a single season

**On wood (visible during pruning):**
- brown to black internal discoloration of the wood
- white spongy rot in the heartwood
- necrotic sectors in cross-section

---

# 2. Risk Situations

- Old vines (over 10 years) with large pruning wounds
- Mechanical pruning creating large unprotected wounds
- Late pruning during rain or frost periods
- History of esca in the plot
- Severe summer drought followed by heavy rainfall (apoplexy trigger)
- Plots with previously infected or dead vines

---

# 3. Field Diagnosis

To confirm esca:

1. Observe the **tiger stripe pattern** on leaves mid-summer.
2. Look for **sudden apoplexy** on individual vines.
3. Cut a symptomatic cane: look for **brown internal discoloration**.
4. Examine the trunk cross-section during pruning: **white spongy rot** is diagnostic.
5. Distinguish from:
   - **Eutypa dieback**: wedge-shaped necrosis in wood, stunted shoots
   - **Magnesium deficiency**: interveinal yellowing but no tiger pattern
   - **Water stress**: uniform wilting, not localized to single vines

A combination of foliar symptoms and wood discoloration confirms the diagnosis.

# 4. Potential Impact on Yield

- Progressive decline of vine productivity over several years
- Apoplexy can kill vines within a single season
- Yield losses of 10–40% in heavily affected plots
- Shortened vine lifespan, requiring early replanting
- No curative treatment currently available

Esca is considered a **long-term threat** to vineyard longevity.

---

# 5. Treatment Strategies — Conventional

There is currently **no curative treatment** authorized for esca.
Management focuses entirely on prevention and limiting spread.

**Wound protection (most effective measure):**
- apply wound sealants or biocontrol agents immediately after pruning
- protect large wounds from rain and frost

**Sanitation:**
- remove and destroy severely affected vines
- avoid leaving infected wood in the plot

**Pruning practices:**
- prune during dry weather
- minimize wound size where possible
- consider double pruning (leaving a sacrificial cane)

---

# 6. Treatment Strategies — Organic Farming

In organic farming, the approach is identical since no chemical curative exists:

- **Trichoderma-based biocontrol agents** applied to pruning wounds
- **Wound sealants** (natural wax-based products)
- strict **sanitation**: remove and burn affected wood
- **double pruning** technique to delay exposure of final wounds
- monitor vines individually to detect early symptoms

Prevention through pruning hygiene is the only effective strategy.

# 7. Adjustments by Severity

**Case 1 — Tiger stripe on isolated leaves, vine still productive**
→ mark affected vines + reinforce wound protection at next pruning.

**Case 2 — Tiger stripe on multiple vines, some yield loss**
→ systematic wound treatment across the plot + remove most affected vines.

**Case 3 — Apoplexy observed**
→ remove and destroy affected vine immediately to prevent spread + replant with certified material.

---

# 8. Preventive Measures

- always protect pruning wounds with certified biocontrol products
- prune during dry, frost-free weather
- use sharp, clean tools to minimize wound surface
- practice double pruning on susceptible plots
- remove and destroy all infected wood — never leave on the soil
- monitor each vine individually every season
- replant with certified disease-free material

---

# 9. Safety and Precautions

- wear PPE when handling infected wood
- disinfect pruning tools between vines in heavily affected plots
- respect regulations on authorized wound protection products
- consult a viticulture advisor for plot-level management strategy
- keep records of affected vines to track progression over years

These recommendations must be adapted to vine age, plot history and local regulations.
