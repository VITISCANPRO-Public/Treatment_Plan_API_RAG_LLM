# 1. Description and Symptoms

Erinose is caused by a microscopic eriophyid mite, not a fungus.
It is often confused with cryptogamic diseases due to its felty appearance on leaves.

**On leaves — upper side:**
- green to yellowish blisters or swellings
- irregular bumpy surface
- deformation of the blade, especially on young leaves

**On leaves — underside:**
- dense white to pinkish felty growth (erineum)
- felty patches correspond exactly to the blisters on the upper side
- color turns brown as the season progresses

**On young shoots and flower clusters:**
- deformation and curling of young tissues
- flower clusters affected early in the season may fail to develop normally
- severe early attacks can reduce fruit set

The mites live and reproduce inside the felty erineum on the underside of leaves.

# 2. Risk Situations

- Warm dry spring accelerating mite reproduction
- Plots with history of erinose
- Vigorous vines producing abundant young foliage
- Absence of natural predators (predatory mites)
- Excessive use of broad-spectrum pesticides eliminating beneficial fauna
- Proximity to wild grapevines which can harbor mite populations

---

# 3. Field Diagnosis

To confirm erinose:

1. Look for **green blisters on the upper side** of young leaves.
2. Flip the leaf: identify **white felty erineum on the underside**.
3. Observe that blisters and felty patches are **perfectly aligned** on both sides.
4. Distinguish from:
   - **Powdery mildew**: white powder on upper side, not blisters
   - **Downy mildew**: oily spots + white downy growth, not blisters
   - **Herbicide damage**: irregular deformations without felty growth
   - **Grape leafhopper**: stippling without felty patches

A ×10 magnifying glass may reveal mites inside the erineum.

# 4. Potential Impact on Yield

- Generally limited impact on mature productive vines
- Young vines more vulnerable: growth can be significantly affected
- Early attack on flower clusters can reduce fruit set
- Rarely causes major yield loss except under very high mite pressure
- Mainly an aesthetic and vigor issue rather than a direct production threat

Erinose is considered a **low to moderate priority** disease in most situations.

# 5. Treatment Strategies — Conventional

General principles:
- intervention is only justified under **high mite pressure** or on young vines
- target treatments at **bud break** when mites emerge from overwintering sites
- avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that eliminate natural predators

Common interventions:
- acaricides authorized for viticulture applied at bud break
- single early treatment often sufficient if timed correctly
- monitor natural predator populations before deciding to treat

In most adult vineyards, erinose does not require systematic treatment.

# 6. Treatment Strategies — Organic Farming

In organic farming, control relies on:

- **sulfur-based products** which have acaricidal activity
- **natural predatory mites** (Typhlodromus pyri) — preserve and encourage
- avoid broad-spectrum treatments that eliminate beneficial fauna
- **canopy management**: improve ventilation to reduce mite-favorable microclimate
- monitor populations carefully before deciding to intervene

Preserving natural predator populations is the most sustainable long-term strategy.

---

# 7. Adjustments by Severity

**Case 1 — A few blisters on isolated leaves, adult vine**
→ monitoring only, no intervention required.

**Case 2 — Multiple leaves affected, young vine or nursery**
→ targeted treatment at bud break + monitor shoot development.

**Case 3 — Early flower cluster damage, high mite pressure**
→ immediate intervention + assess impact on fruit set.

---

# 8. Preventive Measures

- preserve natural predatory mite populations (avoid broad-spectrum pesticides)
- monitor plots from bud break each season
- remove and destroy heavily infested shoots on young vines
- improve canopy ventilation through shoot positioning
- avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization promoting very tender young foliage
- inspect plant material before introducing new vines into the plot

---

# 9. Safety and Precautions

- respect buffer zones (ZNT) and pre-harvest intervals
- wear PPE during all acaricide applications
- carefully read product labels — not all acaricides are authorized in viticulture
- avoid treating during flowering to protect pollinators
- preserve beneficial fauna by choosing selective products

These recommendations must be adapted to vine age, mite pressure level and local regulations.
