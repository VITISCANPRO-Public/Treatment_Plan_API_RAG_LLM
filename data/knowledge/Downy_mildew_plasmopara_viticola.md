# 1. Description and Symptoms

Downy mildew is one of the most damaging cryptogamic diseases in viticulture.
First symptoms typically appear after a wet period followed by mild temperatures.

**On leaves:**
- yellow translucent spots called "oily spots"
- mosaic discoloration of the leaf blade
- white downy growth on the underside after a humid night

**On young shoots:**
- deformations
- localized browning
- stunted growth

**On flower clusters:**
- rapid desiccation
- significant flower drop

Without protection, the disease can spread very quickly.

# 2. Risk Situations

- Alternating rain and mild temperatures (18–25°C)
- Frequent morning dews
- Vigorous or poorly ventilated plots
- History of downy mildew in previous seasons
- Heavy or waterlogged soils
- No treatment applied during sensitive periods

---

# 3. Field Diagnosis

To confirm downy mildew, observe:

1. **Oily spots** visible in raking light.
2. **White downy growth** on the underside of the leaf after a humid night (strong indicator).
3. Symptoms on lower leaves first (upward progression).
4. Distinguish from:
   - *Powdery mildew* → uniform white powder (not localized patches)
   - *Magnesium deficiency* → interveinal yellowing but not oily

A reliable diagnosis requires observing both sides of the leaf simultaneously.

# 4. Potential Impact on Yield

- Significant yield reduction (early defoliation)
- Reduced photosynthesis
- Quality loss risk: irregular ripening, reduced sugar content
- Risk of bunch infection under high disease pressure

Without intervention, the disease can completely compromise the harvest in wet years.

---

# 5. Treatment Strategies — Conventional

General principles:
- intervene **preventively** from the first favorable rainfall
- alternate active ingredient families to limit resistance
- avoid treatments during heavy rain
- maintain regular coverage until bunch closure

Strategies generally rely on:
- systemic products early in the season
- penetrating or translaminar products during active growth
- contact products as backup when weather is uncertain

Final choice depends on:
- grape variety
- plot history
- phenological stage

# 6. Treatment Strategies — Organic Farming

In organic farming, downy mildew control relies on:
- **copper-based products**, within annual regulatory limits
- **biocontrol agents** (natural defense stimulators)
- increased **weather monitoring** to anticipate risk windows
- **prophylaxis**: foliage ventilation, rigorous shoot positioning

Success depends heavily on application regularity and spray quality.

# 7. Adjustments by Severity

**Case 1 — Isolated symptoms**
→ increased monitoring + light intervention if weather is unfavorable.

**Case 2 — Multiple active outbreaks**
→ rapid intervention, reinforced strategy (organic or conventional).

**Case 3 — High pressure after successive rainfall**
→ secure the plot before next rain + close monitoring.

# 8. Preventive Measures

- maintain trellising to improve ventilation
- manage vigor (avoid excess nitrogen)
- control competing ground cover
- use decision support tools (weather models)
- remove heavily infected leaves from the soil

---

# 9. Safety and Precautions

- Strictly respect doses and buffer zones (ZNT)
- Respect pre-harvest intervals
- Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during applications
- Never mix incompatible products
- Check equipment regularly (nozzles, pressure, calibration)

These recommendations must always be adapted to local conditions and authorized products.
