# 1. Description and Characteristics of a Healthy Leaf

A healthy grapevine leaf shows:

- a **uniformly green** blade, free of spots or discoloration
- regular, well-defined veins
- **supple** texture, not curled
- no signs of felty growth, mold, perforation or necrosis
- no blistering, deformation or oily patches
- intact margins, not eaten away or burned

The overall appearance should be homogeneous across rows.

# 2. Indicators of Vineyard Health

A healthy leaf is often a sign of:

- good mineral nutrition
- absence of water stress
- absence of cryptogamic diseases (downy mildew, powdery mildew, anthracnose…)
- absence of pests (mites, leafhoppers…)
- good vigor/crop load balance
- favorable climatic conditions

# 3. Field Diagnosis: Confirming Absence of Disease

To confirm a leaf is healthy:

1. Observe **both sides** of the blade.
2. Verify absence of:
   - brown, black or oily spots
   - white or grey felty growth
   - circular perforations
   - blisters or swellings
3. Check that the leaf is neither curled nor deformed.
4. Compare with other leaves on the same vine.

If in doubt: increase monitoring frequency.

# 4. Impact on Yield

A healthy leaf:

- supports optimal photosynthesis
- promotes regular ripening
- indicates good overall physiological condition of the vineyard
- reduces risk of future attacks by maintaining a robust plant

No intervention required.

# 5. No Treatment Needed

When the CNN identifies a leaf as "healthy", **no curative action is recommended**.

The priority is:

- **regular monitoring**
- anticipating weather-related risks
- maintaining vegetative balance

No product, no correction needed.

# 6. General Preventive Measures (Best Practices)

Even in the absence of disease, it is useful to maintain:

- foliage ventilation (moderate leaf removal)
- trellis management and vigor control
- balanced nutrition (avoid excess and deficiencies)
- reasoned irrigation
- equipment cleaning
- weather monitoring to anticipate cryptogamic risks

These measures strengthen the vine's natural resistance.

# 7. Key Watch Points

- monitor after rainy episodes or heat waves
- check young leaves first → often the first affected when disease appears
- do not confuse:
  - **young healthy leaf** (naturally lighter green)
  - **early chlorosis or stress symptoms**

A healthy leaf requires no chemical or organic intervention.
