# 1. Description and Symptoms

Black rot is a cryptogamic disease that can cause devastating losses on berries.
It is particularly dangerous because symptoms on leaves appear before the most destructive phase on bunches.

**On leaves:**
- small circular light brown spots with a dark border
- black pycnidia (fruiting bodies) visible inside the spots
- spots enlarge and merge under high disease pressure

**On shoots and petioles:**
- elongated dark brown lesions
- similar black pycnidia visible on affected tissues

**On berries:**
- initial light brown spot
- rapid spread covering the entire berry within a few days
- berry shrinks, hardens and turns into a **black mummified berry**
- mummified berries remain attached to the bunch and serve as inoculum the following season

Without intervention, black rot can destroy entire bunches within a week under favorable conditions.

# 2. Risk Situations

- Warm rainy spring and early summer
- Presence of mummified berries from previous season
- Plots with history of black rot
- Dense canopy reducing drying time
- Susceptible varieties
- Delayed start of protection program

# 3. Field Diagnosis

To confirm black rot:

1. Look for **circular brown spots with dark border** on leaves.
2. Identify **black pycnidia** inside leaf spots with a ×10 magnifying glass.
3. Observe **mummified black berries** still attached to the bunch.
4. Distinguish from:
   - **Anthracnose**: perforating lesions, no pycnidia inside spots
   - **Downy mildew**: oily spots + white downy growth underneath
   - **Botrytis**: grey mold, not hard mummified berries

The presence of mummified berries is the most distinctive field indicator.

# 4. Potential Impact on Yield

- Berry losses from 10% to 80% depending on disease pressure and timing
- Entire bunches can be destroyed in severe cases
- Mummified berries perpetuate the disease cycle year after year
- Quality losses: contaminated must from infected berries
- Significant economic impact in warm and humid years

Black rot is considered a **high priority** disease in susceptible plots.

# 5. Treatment Strategies — Conventional

General principles:
- start protection **early**, before symptoms appear on leaves
- maintain regular coverage during the critical period (flowering to pea-sized berry)
- rotate active ingredient families to prevent resistance
- eliminate inoculum sources before the season

Common interventions:
- systemic or penetrating fungicides during critical window
- reinforce after rainfall events exceeding 10mm
- contact products as complement during lower-risk periods

Removing and destroying mummified berries before bud break is essential to reduce initial inoculum.

# 6. Treatment Strategies — Organic Farming

In organic farming, control relies on:

- **copper-based products** within annual regulatory limits
- **biocontrol agents** as preventive support
- strict **sanitation**: remove and destroy all mummified berries and infected wood
- improve canopy ventilation through leaf removal and shoot positioning
- weather monitoring to target application timing

Organic control is more challenging due to limited product range — sanitation and timing are critical.

---

# 7. Adjustments by Severity

**Case 1 — Leaf spots only, no berry symptoms**
→ reinforce monitoring + maintain regular protective coverage.

**Case 2 — First berry symptoms visible**
→ immediate intervention + reinforce before next rain event.

**Case 3 — Multiple mummified berries in the bunch**
→ urgent curative treatment + remove affected bunches to limit spread.

---

# 8. Preventive Measures

- remove and destroy all mummified berries before bud break
- prune and eliminate infected wood during winter
- improve canopy ventilation through shoot positioning and leaf removal
- avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization
- monitor weather closely during critical growth stages
- use decision support tools (disease models)

---

# 9. Safety and Precautions

- respect buffer zones (ZNT) and pre-harvest intervals
- wear PPE during all applications
- calibrate sprayer for good canopy penetration
- never mix incompatible products
- thoroughly clean equipment after use

These recommendations must be adapted to local conditions, variety susceptibility and authorized products.
